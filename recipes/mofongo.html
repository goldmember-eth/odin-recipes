        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 green plantains</li>
            <li>1 lb of chicharron (crunchy pork or chicken)</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, mashed</li>
            <li>4 tsp of oliv oil</li>
            <li>2 cups frying oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely chopped parsley for topping</li>
            <li>sliced lime</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper to taste (no salt for Danny)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the plantains, cut them into 1 1/2-inch slices, soak them in salty water for 15 minutes, drain them and dry them before putting them on the hot skillet with oil.</li>
            <li>Fry them for about 12 minutes at medium-low heat or until they turn light brown. Make sure to turn them. Do not brown them too much, so they are easy to mash. Stick a fork in them to check if they are done.</li>
            <li>Remove them and mash them on a mortar. Add some mashed garlic and pieces of chicharr√≥n.</li>
            <li>Once you have mashed all the plantains, mold them into the shape of half sphere using your hands or a container. Serve hot with chicken broth or your favorite meat.</li>
        </ol>
